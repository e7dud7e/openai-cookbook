       "272  Title: A Hit!; Content: We had an Autumn soup party a couple of weeks ago, featuring 3 different soups and different artisan breads.  The overwhelmingly favorite soup was the Illinois Prairie Corn Chowder.  It couldn't have been easier to prepare, and I added absolutely nothing to it (except the fresh corn, as recommended on the package) and it tasted fantastic.  Everyone wanted my soup recipe and were surprised when I revealed that it was an easy to make packaged soup.<br /><br />The package makes a lot of soup, about 12 servings.  Since I had a large group, I made up two packages.  We were able to send extra servings home with our guests, and still had plenty left over for ourselves.<br /><br />I saw a review that suggested adding some cooked bacon to the soup.  I'm going to try that next time, even though the package mix requires no extra flavoring.  I just like the flavor of bacon.<br /><br />I'd recommend this soup to anyone who likes corn, chowder, and a rich tasty soup.   \n",

Only been taking it for 2 weeks though, but it's certainly much more manageable than drinking directly.  PS:  Still smells awful though.   \n",

It has a slightly medicinal taste I don't care for.  On doing a little research, I found that the bees feed on flowers of the tree that's also called teatree, and if you have ever smelled teetree oil that's what the honey tastes like..almost a menthol taste. But since it is supposed to have such benefits health-wise, and since it was so expensive, I guess I'll go ahead and try using it..maybe to sweeten drinks or something..but for breakfast toast I'll stick to our good local honey.   \n",

Mostly, I believed this helped me some, but I think it would help someone with very coarse hair far more.<br /><br />But it works, and it does what it says it will, which is why it deserves a four-star rating.<br /><br />Barb Caffrey   \n",
